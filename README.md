## 1. Installation


### 1.1 As a Hugo Module (recommended)

> ⚠️ If you installed a [Hugo binary](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#binary-cross-platform), you may not have Go installed on your machine. To check if Go is installed:
> ```
> $ go version
> ```
>  Go modules were considered production ready in v1.14. [Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/). 

1. From your project's root directory, initiate the hugo module system if you haven't already:

    ```bash
    $ hugo mod init github.com/<your_user>/<your_project>
    ```

2. Add the theme's repo to your `config.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    theme: 
       - github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-mini
    ```

### 1.2 As Git Submodule

1. Inside the folder of your Hugo site run:

    ```bash
    $ git submodule add https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-mini.git themes/mini
    ```

2. Add the theme's directory to your `config.yaml`:

    ```yaml
   theme: mini
    ```

For more information read the official [setup guide](//gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.


## 2. Getting started

After installing the theme successfully it requires a just a few more steps to get your site running.


### 2.1 The config file

Take a look inside the [`exampleSite`](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-mini/tree/master/exampleSite) folder of this theme. You'll find a file called [`config.yaml`](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-mini/blob/master/exampleSite/config.yaml). To use it, copy the [`config.yaml`](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-mini/blob/master/exampleSite/config.yaml) in the root folder of your Hugo site. Feel free to change the strings in this theme.

> ⚠️ You may need to delete the line: `themesDir: ../../` 

### 2.2 Default Content Language

You can set default content language by `defaultContentLanguage`:

```yaml
defaultContentLanguage: en
```

Default is `en`. Now support:

- `en`: English
- `zh`: Chinese
- `nl`: Dutch 
- `fr`: French
- `es`: Spanish

More about multiple languages: [Multilingual Mode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/).

```

- static
└── images
    ├── avatar.png
    └── favicon.ico
```

In order to see your site in action, run Hugo's built-in local server.

```bash
$ hugo server
```

Now enter http://localhost:1313 in the address bar of your browser.

### 2.7 Production

To run in production (e.g. to have Google Analytics show up), run HUGO_ENV=production before your build command. For example:

```bash
HUGO_ENV=production hugo
```

Note: The above command will not work on Windows. If you are running a Windows OS, use the below command:

```bash
set HUGO_ENV=production
hugo
```
