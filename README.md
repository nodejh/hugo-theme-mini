# Cactus Theme

Cactus is a minimalistic theme for bloggers based on the default theme of the same-named [Cactus static site generator](//github.com/koenbok/Cactus) written in Python and [Nick Balestra](//github.com/nickbalestra/kactus)'s Jekyll port. Noteworthy features of this Hugo theme are the integration of a comment-system powered by Disqus, a customizable about page, support for RSS feeds, syntax highlighting for source code and sharing options for blog posts.

## Installation

Inside the folder of your Hugo site run:

    $ cd themes
    $ git clone https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-cactus-theme.git

For more information read the official [setup guide](//gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.

### The config file

Take a look inside the [`exampleSite`](//github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-cactus-theme/tree/dev/exampleSite) folder of this theme. You'll find a file called [`config.toml`](//github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-cactus-theme/blob/dev/exampleSite/config.toml).

To use it, copy the [`config.toml`](//github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-cactus-theme/blob/dev/exampleSite/config.toml) in the root folder of your Hugo site. Feel free to change strings as you like to customize your website.

## About page

Use the about page to introduce yourself to your visitors. You can customize the content as you like in the [`config.toml`](//github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-cactus-theme/blob/dev/exampleSite/config.toml). Furthermore, you should replace the [avatar placeholder](//github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-cactus-theme/blob/master/static/images/avatar.png) with a great image of yourself.

## Hide pages

Pages can be hidden and don't appear in the post list on the homepage if you add the variable `hidden = true` to the frontmatter. This allows you to link from elsewhere, i.e. just the menu. 

## Disqus

This theme features a comment system powered by Disqus too. Just add your Disqus-shortname to the [`config.toml`](//github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-cactus-theme/blob/dev/exampleSite/config.toml) and let readers respond to your blog posts.

## Social link icons

You can add a social link panel in the footer by adding entries to the `social` block in the [`config.toml`](//github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-cactus-theme/blob/dev/exampleSite/config.toml). You can choose between two icon fonts:

- [Font awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) or
- [Mono social icons](https://github.com/drinchev/monosocialiconsfont)

Assign either `font-awesome` or `mono-social` to the `iconFont` variable. The Mono social icons offer three styles of icons: -circle, rounded, or default (empty).

## Nearly finished

In order to see your site in action, run Hugo's built-in local server. 

    $ hugo server

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.
